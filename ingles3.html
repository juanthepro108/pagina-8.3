<h2>TALLER INGLES.</h2>
<h3>PUNTO 1</h3>
<h3>A.</h3>
<h3>RULE  1:</h3>
<p>Trear others the way you wish to be treated.</p>
    <p>The good old Golden rule says it all: empatry, tolerance and peace. This principle teaches you to love yourself and love others. It spans cultures and faiths and is a universal age old consept which can't fail !</p>
 

<h3>RULE 2:</h3>
<p>Listen to hear what others have tos say, not to speak.</p>
    <p>Engage in dialogue whith an open mind and the real will to listen to others. Only then will you be able to understand each other and build bringes. Change cannot happen and peace cannot be stabliched if people are unable to communicate with others; to listen to their experiences and views and show empathy, understanding and compassion.</p>

        <h3>RULE 3:</h3>
<p>Accept difference of opinión </p>
<p>We all have different opinions and we may not all agree on the same things. Building compromise and mutual understanding is incredibly importan. Sometimes we simply need to agree to disagree and recognise that  there are different beliefs and forms of expression othan our own.</p>
 
    <h3>RULE 4:</h3>
<p>Do not fight violence withe violence.</p>
<p>Violence is never the answer. Peace can only be brought though free will, dialogue, empathy and forgiveness. Do not stop to same level as someone who is violent and therefore continue the vicious cycle. This does not change anything.</p>
 
    <h3>RULE 5:</h3>
<p>Accept that identity is fluid.</p>
<p>Any one person can have multiple aspects to their identity. Identity comprises many elements such as nationality,</p>
<p>cultural-linguistic origin, age and religious beliefs. Identity can and does change, taking on many new forms and</p>
<p>means of personal expression as we learn new languages, move home, adopt new beliefs, marry into a dif erent</p>
<p>tradition and experience life! Do not put people into a box. Avoid categorising people according to and us vs.</p>
<p>them narrative and remember: we are all singular individuals with unique experiences. Such approaches and</p>
<p>narratives are highly divisive and unproductive.</p>
 
    <h3>RULE 6:</h3>
<p>Avoid stereotypes.</p>
<p>Take people for the individuals they are. Avoid</p>
<p>misconceptions, stereotypes and toxic narratives and get to</p>
<p>know a person instead. This will avoid of ence,</p>
<p>misunderstandings and ultimately help you to create a real</p>
<p>bond with others based on true understanding, empathy and</p>
<p>trust. After all, no one likes to be judged – especially from</p>
<p>the outside</p>
 
    <h3>B.</h3>
        <h3>PASADO SIMPLE.</h3>
<p>-I WILL TREAT MY MOTHER LIKE SHE IS TREATING ME</p>
<h3>PRESENTE PERFECTO</h3>
    <p>-I TREATED MY MOTHER LIKE SHE WANTED TO BE A TREATERS</p>
